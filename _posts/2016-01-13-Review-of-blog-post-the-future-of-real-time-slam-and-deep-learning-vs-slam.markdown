[The Future of Real-Time SLAM and Deep Learning vs SLAM](http://www.computervisionblog.com/2016/01/why-slam-matters-future-of-real-time.html)
(Tomasz Malisiewicz; 13 Jan 2016)

**Description:** <br />
This blog post is a summarization of T. Malisiewicz' workshop ["Future of Real-Time SLAM"](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/thefutureofslam/programme/) at [ICCV 2015](http://pamitc.org/iccv15/).

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enables to simultaneously build 3D maps of the world while tracking the location and orientation of the camera.
It's a real-time version of Structure from Motion (SfM) and focuses on geometric problems (i.e. enabling a robot to go towards a fridge without hitting a wall), 
while Deep Learning focuses on recognition problems (i.e. identifying items inside a fridge).
One of the most important applications of SLAM are self-driving cars.

... to be continued.
